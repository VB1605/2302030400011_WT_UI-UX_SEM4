                    For a long time I wanted to communicate with people in general in a non-chat format. It was only
                    when I was on vacation with limited access and resorted to exchanging long emails with a friend
                    who was similarly inclined that I realized that what I wanted was penpals. 45 years ago I had
                    them but I had forgotten about the whole things. The social networking apps that are really
                    fronts for dating apps are a poor substitute for PPW.

                    This is hands down the best pen pal site I've been to. There's something about the format that
                    is ideal for fostering a different experience here than on other sites, whether they be dating
                    sites or pen pal sites or whatever. Maybe it's the short profile text and single profile
                    photo.It sets up for just a quick intro and encourages people to take a leap toward setting up
                    their own communication. It must also be the type of users brought here. I don't know what it
                    is, but thank you and please don't ever transition to become like interpals or some other site,
                    because this place is unique.

                    Just a quick note to say thank you so much for having created this site. If it wasn't for you,
                    then I would never have met what I am hoping will turn out to be my best friend forever. I will
                    certainly promote your site to everyone, whether they want to know or not!! If the need ever
                    arises, I will return with lightening speed. Thank you once again.

                    you just proved to me that a human being can do wonders even if he's alone. a huge big up for you
                    mate, you just inspired me in a unique way. I just spent one day here, I reaaally loved it, I think
                    it's even better than Facebook! or any other place! keep it clean, keep it alive. Thank you for
                    bringing the world more to our arms.

                    PenPal makes me feel valued and definitely more free. There’s a lack of ties and complication and
                    there are chances for more meaningful connections and relationships which is amazing.

            <p class="text">
                With PenPal World you can find as many pen pals as you want from the comfort of your own home! Just sign
                up and start searching for members all over the world. When you receive a message, you'll be notified
                conveniently at your email address.
            </p>
            <p class="heading fs-4 fw-bolder">Cost</p>
            <p class="text">
                PenPal World offers a limited FREE account that allows you to contact and reply to up to 3 members
                within 24 hours. PenPal World also offers a very affordable VIP membership starting at 10 cents per day,
                which allows you to write to up to 50 members per day.

            <p class="heading fs-4 fw-bolder">Protecting our member's privacy</p>
            <p class="text">
                We do not sell or rent any information you submit to this site.
                We do not display your email address (as some other penpal sites do). The Penpal World system is set up
                so that you can communicate with people entirely through our site without ever revealing an email
                address. We do display your age, gender, and country because other members are very interested in this
                information and use it to select penpals. However, we do not display your birthday, and other
                information such as state/province, city, or relationship status is optional.
                The privacy of our members is our #1 priority. While other similar pen pal websites display a lot of
                personal information about their members, such as their email addresses, PenPal World does not. In fact,
                within a member's profile, all we show is that member's age (not birthday), gender, and country. All
                other information, such as state/province, city, or relationship status, is optional.
                We also review every new and updated profile picture before it's displayed. This allows us to filter out
                inappropriate ones.
            </p>
            <p class="heading fs-4 fw-bolder">Scams</p>
            <p class="text">
                Every social network website deals with the Nigerian scam. At PenPal World we deal with this issue in a
                very agressive way keeping our service as clean as possible. Members have the opportunity to easily
                report suspicious accounts with a click of their mouse. Also in the background several features are
                running to catch them before they can do any damage.
                We also block over 100,000 fake domain email addresses (such as meantodeal.com) and temporary/disposable
                email addresses (such as tempmailo.org) that are commonly used by scammers.
                We also do not allow new members to post comments or write to other members for the first 24 hours.This
                way they can't contact anyone before their account is banned.
            </p>

            <p class="heading fs-4 fw-bolder">Cancellation</p>
            <p class="text">
                You can easily cancel your membership at any time, online, 24 hours a day. There are no cancellation
                fees.
